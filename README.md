# Retrieve some data from APIs with Python
Using Python and various tools to make API calls (GET/POST requests), 
through known websites/social media APIs, in order to retrieve some useful data 
to store, manipulate, and even to get insights from it.

## Disclaimer:
The scripts / tools are for educational purposes only, 
using free authenticated (api-key/token) accounts for developing - to learn 
some basic work with APIs.
I have tried to follow websites' terms of use and their strict rules 
(when writing these scripts), including api calls/requests limit.
So whether one ore more scripts violate some TOS somehow, 
please let me know and I will remove this repo/problematic script!
Use at your own risk.
